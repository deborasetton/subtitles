1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,740
When you web app
 is causing a scandal

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:05,320
Try the "Elements" in
 the Sources panel

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,080
When you Javascript
is making making a blunder

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,740
Use the console and
JavaScript debugger

5
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,300
When a web page is
a cause in bandwidth stress

6
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,960
The network panel
shows you the request

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,760
So speed up your page
with just a few rules

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,160
It's time to discover

9
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,440
DevTools

10
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,260
If you've been a developer
for a while,

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,200
odds are you remember
the battle days

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,880
of web development
debugging.

13
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,560
If you get a JavaScript
error in your web page,

14
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,980
well, maybe the browser
gives you a line number,

15
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,080
maybe it doesn't

16
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,360
and maybe that
line number brings

17
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,360
you to where the
error actually happened.

18
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,060
Same thing goes for
stylesheet debugging.

19
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,480
You have a CSS
property and

20
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,080
why isn't it showing up
on the page?!

21
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,020
Well, you go back to your file,

22
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,480
you update it, check the browser.

23
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,440
You're back to the file,
update it, check your browser.

24
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,400
Luckily, these days we have
Chrome Developer Tools.

25
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,720
Developer Tools allows
you to do things like

26
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:02,100
live edit your HTML and
CSS right there in the page.

27
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,800
It comes with a powerful
JavaScript debugger,

28
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,360
and also a bunch of tools
to optimize your website performance.

29
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,180
It makes programming
for the web...

30
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:11,100
dare I say...

31
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,280
Easy.

32
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:15,980
I'm Greg Pollock,
and in this course,

33
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,840
we're gonna be walking
through all the major features

34
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,360
of Chrome Developer Tools.

35
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:21,580
Now, we're gonna start
with some of the basics

36
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,240
which you already
may be familiar with,

37
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,520
so feel free to skip
ahead to the next couple

38
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:26,420
chapters

39
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,200
to get into the more
advanced material.

40
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,680
Meanwhile, in Level 1,

41
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,400
we're gonna be jumping
into the Elements panel.

42
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,640
Throughout the videos and the challenges,
we're gonna be working with a scheduling app

43
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,860
which we've been working on -- 
that you can see here.

44
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,000
We wanna make some
changes to this application.

45
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,680
First thing we'll want to do
is open Developer Tools.

46
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,560
To do that, we look for the icon
on our browser with the 3 lines on it.

47
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,780
Then, find the "Tools" menu item,

48
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,100
then click on "Developer Tools".

49
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:56,200
If you're not already familiar
with the keyboard shortcut

50
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,040
to call up Developer Tools and to close
Developer Tools from within your browser,

51
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,780
take note of it here, listed
next to the menu item.

52
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:06,640
It will be much more convenient to open it
using that keyboard shortcut next time.

53
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,980
By default, DevTools will appear at the bottom
part of your Chrome window.

54
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:15,620
You can close it anytime, either by clicking
that "x" icon in the top left

55
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,840
or simply by using
our keyboard shortcut.

56
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,060
So here in our calendar application,

57
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,160
we wanna make some changes to
the HTML structure of it.

58
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,300
Now, we could go back onto our server
and make the changes there,

59
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,920
and then refresh our
browser,

60
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,400
but maybe we just wanna play around
and live edit the page.

61
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:38,080
To do that, we wanna make sure
we're in the Elements panel you see here.

62
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:41,760
In this panel, you can see
a bunch of HTML on the left-side,

63
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,100
and a bunch of CSS on the right.

64
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,120
But what you're really seeing
there on the left side

65
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,780
is a representation of the DOM,
or Document Object Model.

66
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,820
You can think of it as a collection of
 the different elements

67
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,040
in your HTML put into
sort of a tree format.

68
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,720
So, if you want, you can press

69
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,500
on those ittle triangle shapes
and it will show you

70
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:02,560
more or less code
in that document tree.

71
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
If you're looking at
your rendered HTML page

72
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,340
and you're
wondering, well,

73
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,700
what element created
that particular element,

74
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,560
what you can do is:

75
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:13,100
right-click on the element,
(in our case, we're gonna click on the button)

76
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,540
and select "Inspect Element".

77
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,420
This will open the Elements panel,
if we don't already have it opened,

78
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,940
and shows us that particular
element highlighted inside the DOM.

79
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,580
You might also notice that
 it's showing us the CSS

80
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,320
for that element on the right side,

81
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,240
but we'll get more
into that on the next level.

82
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,840
Another way you can select an element
is by clicking the magnifying glass

83
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,300
in the bottom-left of the screen
to enter the Element Selection Mode.

84
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,260
Then, when you hover
over the page,

85
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,280
you can see the different
element boundaries

86
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,400
and when you left-click on one,

87
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,760
it will select that element
in the Elements panel.

88
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,200
Now, let's go ahead and
make some live changes.

89
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,120
For example, let's change 
the text on our button.

90
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,740
To change that text,
all we have to do is

91
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:51,540
double-click
on it,

92
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,280
type a new title,

93
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,260
and then we can just hit Enter
when we're done

94
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,920
or click somewhere else on the page.

95
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,260
If we right-click on a particular element,

96
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,960
we're given a bunch
of different options,

97
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,360
including the ability to
add or edit attributes.

98
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,860
Let's go ahead and add an 
 "id" attribute to this element.

99
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,440
Pretty easy.

100
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,520
Also in this menu,
we can choose

101
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,200
to edit a node
as HTML

102
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:18,780
where we can change any part of the 
element or add additional elements.

103
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,740
Finally, if we click and
drag an element,

104
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:25,760
we can change its
location on the page.
Finally, if we click and
drag an element,

105
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,920
we can change its
location on the page.

106
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,940
It shouldn't come
as a surprise that

107
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,940
you can select any element
and hit the delete button

108
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,180
to remove
that element

109
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,420
or even right-click and select the
"Delete" menu item.

110
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,340
Well, now it's time for you to practice

111
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,480
using some of these
techniques and the challenges.
